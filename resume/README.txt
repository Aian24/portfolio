Place your resume PDF in this folder and name it exactly:
mark-adrian-basagre-resume.pdf

Optional: Add your resume photo
- Place a headshot at: ../assets/images/resume.png
- The resume page will show it on the right side of the header and include it in the PDF.

Then the "Resume" and "Download as PDF" actions on the site will work.
